              Dan and Kayleigh spent 2017 travelling / eating their way through South East Asia on a “make it up as they we go along” travel plan. They decided to take a detour to the Philippines to visit Kayleigh's Lola (Grandma) as she was having an 80th birthday party in Cebu, this was where they fell in love with Filipino food and the idea was born!
