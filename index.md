about-title: WHO WE ARE
about-copy: "Dan and Kayleigh made the cliché move to take a year out and travel South
  East Asia and eat their way through as many different countries they could afford.
  The trip was “make it up as we go along” travel plan. They decided to take a detour
  to the Philippines to visit Kayleigh's Lola (Grandma) for her 80th birthday party,
  this was where they fell in love with Filipino food and the idea of the Pork Shack
  was born!\n\nBoth Dan and Kayleigh have worked in the events sector but on different
  platforms which makes the perfect team. \n\nDan is a fully trained chef and has
  been working in the industry for over 10 years; he has worked in restaurants, event
  catering, he was a personal chef and even ran his own novelty cake business. \n\nKayleigh
  has worked in events since leaving University, her experience relies heavily in
  event production, working on events like the London Olympics and music festivals.
