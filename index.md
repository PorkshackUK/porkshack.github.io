about-title: WHO WE ARE
about-copy: "Dan and Kayleigh made the cliché move to take a year out and travel South
  East Asia and eat their way through as many different countries they could afford.
  The trip was “make it up as we go along” travel plan. They decided to take a detour
  to the Philippines to visit Kayleigh's Lola (Grandma) for her 80th birthday party,
  this was where they fell in love with Filipino food and the idea of the Pork Shack
  was born!\n<br>\n<br>Both Dan and Kayleigh have worked in the events sector but
  on different platforms which makes the perfect team. \n<br>\n<br>Dan is a fully
  trained chef and has been working in the industry for over 10 years; he has worked
  in restaurants, event catering, he was a personal chef and even ran his own novelty
  cake business. \n<br>\n<br>Kayleigh has worked in events since leaving University,
  her experience relies heavily in event production, working on events like the London
  Olympics and music festivals. \n"
food-title: FILIPINO FUSION STREET FOOD
food-copy: "We take a modern spin on traditional Filipino dishes by reconstructing
  popular Filipino family favourites and turning them into street food feasts.  We
  offer vegan alternatives; it’s usually pulled jackfruit which has a very similar
  texture to pulled pork. We ensure we always offer gluten free and dairy free on
  our menus. We also use gluten free soy sauce which is used in most of our dishes.\n<br>\n<br>We
  only use good quality fresh ingredients and we aim to use local suppliers where
  we can, independent and great quality. We only use British Free-range pork, which
  is from our local butcher.   We make all our own curry pastes, spice blends and
  sauces.  All our crockery, cups, lids, cutlery and napkins are biodegradable which
  means they are 100% compostable.\n<br>\n<br>In our prep kitchen we compost all our
  food waste so nothing goes to landfill. "
