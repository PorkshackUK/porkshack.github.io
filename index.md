hero-copy: The Pork Shack takes a modern spin on traditional Filipino dishes by reconstructing
  popular Filipino family favourites and turning them into street food feasts. We
  only use good quality fresh ingredients in our dishes, our pork is sourced locally
  from an independent butcher who supplies free range, rare breed, high welfare pigs.

about-title: WHO WE ARE
about-copy: Dan and Kayleigh spent 2017 travelling / eating their way through South
  East Asia on a “make it up as they go along” travel plan. They decided to take a
  detour to the Philippines to visit Kayleigh's Lola (Grandma) as she was having an
  80th birthday party in Cebu, this was where they fell in love with Filipino food
  and the idea of the Pork Shack was born!
